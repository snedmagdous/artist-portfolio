HOMEPAGE - INDIGENOUS FUTURISM PHILOSOPHY
=================================================================

Indigenous Futurism Definition:
Initially a science fiction genre, Indigenous Futurism (المستقبلية الأصيلة) is a movement that envisions centering Indigenous ways of being as the architecture for tomorrow. It is a daily practice of carving out time to reimagine what freedom should look like. Through art, we open real, tangible routes to guide us toward this future—compelling ourselves in even the tiniest ways to create space for worlds that should and will exist.

Each day, we must create worlds where we lose the identities we built around our wounds, and where liberation becomes a state of being, not just a state of imagining. Through my creative work, I explore how this daily reimagining transforms resistance into regeneration, turning our visions into inevitable realities that must be reckoned with.

As Walidah Imarisha puts it, "whenever we try to envision a world without war, without violence, without prisons, without capitalism, we are engaging in speculative fiction. All organizing is science fiction."

Key Quote: "We are not vanishing. We are becoming."
Arabic Translation: "نحنا ننولد من جديد ولا نختفي في الأفق"

About MĀYĀ Murry:
Maya Murry exists at the intersection of worlds that rarely meet. As a Computer Science student at Cornell University, she architects deep learning systems that can decode pain from heartbeats and builds AI frameworks that protect healthcare data across enterprise systems. Her technical mastery spans from adversarial machine learning to full-stack applications, but her code carries something deeper—a vision of technology as liberation.

Behind the algorithms and neural networks lives an artist whose documentaries screen to hundreds, whose murals transform communities, and whose poetry bridges the intimate and the political. Her films like "Love as Revolution" and "Our Ancestors Are Still Singing" weave stories of resistance across cultures, while her large-scale public art projects have raised over $18,000 in community funding for Palestinian solidarity and Jewish liberation.

As President of Students for Justice in Palestine and an organizer across multiple movements, Maya doesn't just build bridges between technology and art—she constructs pathways between communities fighting for liberation. Her international fieldwork spans from documenting Indigenous resilience in Cambodia to preserving Zapotec language in Mexico, always seeking to understand how traditional wisdom can inform technological futures.

In every line of code she writes and every frame she films, Maya is answering the same question: How can we use the tools of tomorrow to honor the wisdom of yesterday and create more just worlds today? Her work suggests that the future doesn't have to abandon the past—it can carry it forward, transformed and transforming.

Philosophy - Digital Ancestralism:
"Technology isn't neutral—it carries the values of its creators. I choose to build systems that remember where they came from and know where they're going. Every algorithm is an ancestor, every dataset a story, every application an act of cultural preservation or destruction." — Maya's approach to ethical technology

ART PORTFOLIO
=================================================================

Art Philosophy:
"My paintings serve as bridges between worlds—ancestral and futuristic, traditional and technological, sacred and digital. Through canvas and pigment, I explore how indigenous wisdom can inform and transform our understanding of future possibilities. Each brushstroke carries the weight of history while reaching toward tomorrow. In this practice, I find that the oldest stories become the most radical visions of what could be." — Māyā Murry

PAINTINGS:

Ancestral Visions Series (2020-2024):
A five-painting chronicle of transformation spanning four years, documenting the journey from spiritual disconnection and chronic pain to reclaimed power and embodied presence. Each piece serves as a milestone in healing—from breaking four years of creative silence to reclaiming bodily autonomy, from channeling necessary rage to reconnecting with ancestral protection.

Central Painting - "Ancestral Witness" (2020-2024):
A self-portrait born from one of the darkest periods of my life—chronic pain, depersonalization, and spiritual disconnection. This painting represents the recognition that even in profound suffering, protective forces always surround us. The Arabic text "يا من بيدها مفاتيح الكون, اجعلي معاناتي ثواب لتحقيق كل ماتمنيته" translates to "O you who holds the keys to the universe, make my suffering a reward for achieving everything I have wished for."

"Water Keeper" (2024):
The first painting I created after not touching a paintbrush for four years. This marked my return to art and my freedom from the fear of putting brushes down again. The Water Keeper is a spiritual guardian who protects herself, her environment, and those she loves. She embodies the version of myself I was aspiring to become: fierce, sensual, unbothered, patient, and soft all simultaneously, with water as the element that flows through it all.

"Fire Bearer" (2024):
Inspired by multi-armed Indian goddesses, this painting shows a woman with luminous white eyes, energetically in control of her body and the environment, sunset, and fire around her. This represents a reclamation of rage — allowing oneself to feel anger in order to exorcise it and release all versions of the self once created for survival. The Arabic text "استعيد ما يخصني" translates to "I return what is mine."

"Forest Sovereign" (2024):
A celebration of reclaimed bodily autonomy after healing from debilitating chronic pain and reproductive trauma. The woman shines in her element—sensual but completely unbothered, alone, and thriving as she navigates this forest of souls. She serves as protector and sovereign of these lands, representing the power that comes from finally feeling at home in one's own body.

"Moon Daughter" (2024):
A reclamation of softness and femininity, representing my journey back to feeling like someone's daughter again. This painting counters a poem I once wrote called "Nobody's Daughter" during a time when chronic pain left me feeling spiritually mismatched from all earthly and familial ties. Moon Daughter signifies reclaiming my status as daughter—of having come from somewhere and thus going somewhere, reconnecting with my lineage and my right to tenderness.

Artist Statement for Ancestral Visions:
"This series spans four transformative years—beginning in 2020 during my darkest period of chronic pain, depersonalization, and spiritual disconnection following a severe bike accident that left me with a black eye and deeper wounds that couldn't be seen. For four years, I couldn't touch a paintbrush, paralyzed by the fear that if I put it down, I might never pick it up again.

The journey began with 'Water Keeper' in 2024—my breakthrough painting that broke the four-year silence and freed me from the creative lapse. What followed was a rapid succession of works documenting my healing: 'Forest Sovereign' celebrating my reclamation of bodily autonomy after years of debilitating chronic pain and reproductive trauma; 'Moon Daughter' reclaiming the softness and status of daughter I had lost when pain made me feel like 'nobody's daughter,' misunderstood by my inability to articulate the depth of my spiritual, mental, and physical devastation.

'Fire Bearer' channels the necessary rage—allowing myself to feel anger in order to exorcise it, to release all versions of myself I had created just to survive. Finally, I returned to complete 'Ancestral Witness,' begun in 2020 as a desperate prayer during my spiritual untethering, now finished with Palestinian tribal tattoos and ancestral butterflies—a testament that protective forces surrounded me even in my deepest darkness.

Each painting represents a different facet of reclamation: rage transformed into power, bodily autonomy restored, femininity and heritage connections renewed, and spiritual protection recognized. Together, they map a journey from survival to sovereignty, from disconnection to embodied presence, from nobody's daughter to a woman who can finally be fierce, sensual, unbothered, patient, and soft simultaneously." — Artist, 2024

Other Painting Series:

"Digital Ceremony" (2023):
Traditional ceremonies reimagined in digital spaces, questioning the nature of sacred practice in virtual worlds. These works explore how ritual and technology can coexist in harmony.

"In the Image of My Queens, I Stand" (2025):
Dreamtime stories told through neon colors and cyberpunk aesthetics, bridging ancient wisdom with modern technology. Fluorescent pigments illuminate traditional narratives.

"Mamma, I'm Fine" (2024):
A powerful single piece exploring the complex emotions of reassurance and vulnerability, inspired by personal poetry and community murals that speak to the immigrant experience.

ILLUSTRATIONS:

"Divine Feminine" Portrait Series (2024):
A pen portrait series born from love and healing - my first artworks after a four-year pause from creating, inspired by my love language of reminding the women in my life of their power and beauty as goddesses in perpetual evolution.

Artist Statement for Divine Feminine:
"Divine Feminine" was born from the intersection of healing and love. After four years away from art - dealing with deep chronic pain, spiritual, physical, and emotional struggles - I knew that when I returned to creating, my first works had to be offerings of love.

My love language has always been reminding people of their power and beauty as goddesses in perpetual evolution. As I was just remembering how to feel that for myself for the first time in years, I decided that the first art I would create would make the people around me - the people I care most about - feel so loved and so beautiful.

Using only black pen on paper, each portrait became a meditation on seeing and celebrating divine feminine energy. These aren't just portraits - they're love letters, mirrors reflecting back the goddess I see in each of these women, reminders of their power written in their ancestral languages, adorned with the cultural symbols that honor their heritage.

This series marked my return not just to art, but to the practice of loving others as a pathway back to loving myself. Every line drawn was an act of healing, every portrait a celebration of the women who held me through my darkest times and taught me what divine feminine strength truly looks like.

FILM PORTFOLIO
=================================================================

Director's Vision:
"Through film, I explore how indigenous stories can reshape our understanding of time, technology, and possibility. Each project is an invitation to reimagine the future through the lens of ancestral wisdom. My work spans from intimate documentaries that preserve cultural knowledge to speculative narratives that envision indigenous-led futures, always asking: what worlds become possible when we center indigenous voices in storytelling?" — Māyā Murry, Director

Documentary Approach:
"My documentary practice centers love as resistance, exploring how personal narratives intersect with collective struggles for justice. Each film serves as both intimate memoir and political act, weaving together ancestral wisdom and contemporary activism. Through experimental forms and community collaboration, these works ask: how do we honor our ancestors while imagining liberated futures? How does love become our most radical tool for transformation?" — Māyā Murry, 2025

DOCUMENTARIES:

An intimate exploration of how love functions as a radical act of resistance within social justice movements. The film weaves together personal narratives and community organizing to examine love as both a healing practice and revolutionary force.

Details:
- Duration: 11 minutes
- Format: Short Film, Experimental Documentary
- Role: Director, Editor, Producer

Synopsis: The final minutes of this film, where I speak about "letting the dead go home to learn what it means to love again," serve as Khadra's opening sequence, triggering the deeper ancestral exploration of the documentary that follows. Screened strategically before The Encampments movie locally, in solidarity with Palestinian, Black, Indigenous, & Jewish Liberation movements.

Funding: Cornell Society for the Humanities Award, Rural Humanities Seminar Award

Director's Statement: "This film emerged from my own journey of understanding love not as a passive emotion, but as an active choice to resist systems of oppression. Through intimate conversations with organizers and activists, I discovered that love—for community, for justice, for our ancestors—becomes the fuel that sustains movements when everything else feels impossible, and that murals can become a medium to project and manifest this radical future we imagine."

Production Notes: "Shot over 8 months across multiple communities, this film prioritized consent and collaboration at every stage. Participants maintained editorial control over their segments, ensuring their stories remained authentic to their experiences."

Key Quote from Interview:
"'Love as Liberation' is crucial because it's only through love that you can truly free people or experience freedom. And I believe that the mural artists that paint or create things on walls are doing the exact same thing. They are moving through time and space and learning more about themselves and putting something beautiful that's reflective of themselves on a canvas. To me, that is love in action, which leads to liberation - for the artist and for the people in the space." — Megan Omohundro, Executive Director of the Community School of Music & Arts

Connection to Mural Work: The themes explored in this documentary found physical expression in a community-funded mural project at the Community School of Music & Arts - produced by the same director, Māyā Murry. In a way, the mural and documentary are the same brainchild, both titled 'Love as Revolution.' This large-scale collaborative artwork brings the revolutionary power of love into public space, creating a lasting visual reminder of our collective capacity for radical healing and transformation.

PERSONAL NARRATIVES & HEALING JOURNEY
=================================================================

Chronic Pain and Healing:
Maya's artistic journey is deeply intertwined with her experience of chronic pain, depersonalization, and spiritual disconnection following a severe bike accident that left her with physical and invisible wounds. For four years, she couldn't touch a paintbrush, paralyzed by the fear that if she put it down, she might never pick it up again.

The breakthrough came in 2024 with "Water Keeper" - her first painting after the four-year silence. This marked not just a return to art but freedom from the creative paralysis. The healing journey continued through multiple artworks documenting her reclamation of bodily autonomy, rage transformation, and reconnection with ancestral protection.

From "Nobody's Daughter" to Reconnection:
During her darkest period, Maya wrote a poem called "Nobody's Daughter" when chronic pain left her feeling spiritually mismatched from all earthly and familial ties. The painting "Moon Daughter" represents her journey back to feeling like someone's daughter again - reclaiming her status as having come from somewhere and thus going somewhere, reconnecting with her lineage and her right to tenderness.

Love as Healing Practice:
Maya's love language has always been reminding people of their power and beauty. The "Divine Feminine" portrait series emerged from this practice - as she was learning to feel beautiful and powerful for herself again, she decided her first artworks would make the people around her feel loved and seen as goddesses.

Technique Spotlight - Returning to Art:
After four years away from creating due to trauma and chronic pain, Maya's return to art was methodical and intentional. She started with simple materials - black pen on paper - removing barriers that might create fear of not finishing. Each portrait in the "Divine Feminine" series became a meditation on seeing beauty and strength, using art as a tool for healing both herself and her subjects.

Cultural Identity and Heritage:
Throughout her work, Maya integrates multiple cultural elements reflecting her Palestinian-Jordanian heritage. Palestinian tribal tattoos appear in her self-portraits, Arabic text carries prayers and affirmations, and her work consistently centers Palestinian liberation and solidarity with other Indigenous struggles.

Academic and Artistic Integration:
Maya's unique position as both a computer science student and visual artist allows her to explore questions about technology, ethics, and liberation. Her academic work in AI and healthcare technology carries the same values as her artistic practice - using tools and platforms to serve marginalized communities and preserve cultural knowledge.
