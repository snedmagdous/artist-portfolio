# Poetry Page Development Notes

## Current Status
- **Original poetry page backed up** at: `src/pages/writing/poetry/index.js.backup`
- **Current page**: "Coming Soon" with blinking dots (like other pages)
- **Video background**: poetry.MP4 with brightness(0.6) contrast(1) saturate(1.3)

## Poetry Selection Strategy (Discussed 2025-09-20)

### Recommended Approach: Mixed Published & Unpublished
- Include both published poems (credibility) and unpublished gems (exclusivity)
- Quality over quantity: 10-15 strongest pieces
- Show range within Indigenous Futurism aesthetic
- Use as preview for future collection

### Website-Specific Strategy
1. **Lead with most powerful piece** to hook visitors
2. **Include 1-2 recent unpublished poems** to show active creation
3. **Consider web-only exclusive pieces** that won't be in collection
4. **Leave readers wanting more** - not entire collection

### Collection Building Strategy
- Use website as **living portfolio** for editors/publishers
- **Track engagement** on poems to identify collection anchors
- **Test new work** on audience before submitting elsewhere
- Indigenous Futurism theme is unique and marketable

## Original Poetry Page Features to Restore
- 5 poetry collections with hover effects:
  - Digital Ancestors (Techno-Spiritualism)
  - Neon Prophecies (Urban Mysticism)
  - Quantum Ceremony (Dimensional Spirituality)
  - Biomech Dreams (Bio-Integration)
  - Star Navigation (Cosmic Exploration)
- Interactive cards with particle effects
- Animated typing verses on hover
- Poet statement section
- Sophisticated visual effects and animations

## Next Steps for Poetry Page
1. Select 10-15 poems following strategy above
2. Organize into thematic collections
3. Replace placeholder collections with real poems
4. Restore interactive features from backup
5. Consider adding engagement tracking
6. Test with small audience before full launch

## Technical Notes
- Uses writing.module.css for styling
- Complex React hooks for animations
- Particle effects and floating verse overlays
- Video background integration via Layout component
